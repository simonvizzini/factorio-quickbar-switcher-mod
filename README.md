## Quickbar switcher

Allows you to easily manage up to 5 individual quickbar layouts with the press of a hotkey.

Useful if you want to have different quickbar layouts for different tasks. For example: one for base building, one for train building, one for combat, and so on.

Please note that for switching you will currently need enough empty space in your inventory to temporarily hold all your current quickbar items. You will receive a message if there is not enough space in your inventory. In a future version the whole moving process will be done in a smarter way so that only 1 empty inventory slot will be necessary to switch between full quickbar layouts.

## Usage

1. Press ALT + 2-5 to create a new quickbar layout
2. Setup your new quickbar.
3. Switch between layouts with ALT + 1-5
4. ...
5. Profit! :)
