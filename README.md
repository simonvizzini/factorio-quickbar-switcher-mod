## Quickbar switcher

Allows you to easily manage up to 5 individual quickbar layouts with the press of a hotkey.

Useful if you want to have different quickbar layouts for different tasks. For example: one for base building, one for train building, one for combat, and so on.

Please note that the ALT hotkey of this mod will also trigger the default "Info view" keybinding. I suggest to change the info view keybinding to another key, for example "I".

## Highlights

* Can switch between full quickbar layouts even if inventory is full. This works by using the players cursor stack (if available and empty) in the same way as a player would manually re-arrange his quickbar.
* If players cursor stack is currently holding something then 1 empty slot from the inventory will be used to perform the switch. If neither the cursor stack nor an empty inventory slot is available then a switch canno be performed and a message will be printed to the player.
* Works with any inventory/quickbar size (vanilla or modded)
* Should work just fine in multiplayer (haven't really tested, please report if you experience any issues)
* No cheating involved: does not destroy any items or create items out of thin air.

## Usage

1. Press ALT + [2-5] to create a new quickbar layout
2. Setup your new quickbar.
3. Switch between layouts with ALT + [1-5]
4. ...
5. Profit! :)
